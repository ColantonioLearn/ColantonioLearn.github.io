<body>
<div class="blurb">
		<p>I'm Joseph, a Visiting Fellow in HGSE, and a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Psychology department at Rutgers University – Newark with a concentration in Cognitive Development.
		I received his BA in Applied Mathematics jointly from Rutgers University – Newark and NJIT in 2016, graduating Summa Cum Laude. Broadly, I am interested in human learning and curiosity
		from a computational perspective, with a recent emphasis on how findings in these areas can inform meaningful interventions related to STEM Education. In particular, I'm interested in
		how the mechanisms of conceptual change are affected by various factors such as learning contexts, individual differences, and emotions. To do so, I combine methods from computational
		modeling and machine learning with his research interests in psychology. </p>

		<p>Outside of academia, I am an (on/off again) artist, (okay) climber, and starting to get into light video editing. I showcase both of these things mainly on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.mountainboy" >Instagram page</a>.</p>
