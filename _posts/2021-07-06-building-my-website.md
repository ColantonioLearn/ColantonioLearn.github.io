Recently, I've been more motivated to branch out and push past my comfort zone. This may be due to a number of reasons -- but I'll give most of the credit to therapy and more free-time.

Here, to get github pages running, I've been following the tutorial written up be [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Their instructions are incredibly clear so far! But, time will tell (roughly 10 minutes from now) whether the steps following blog posts are similarly clear.

For HTML and CSS, I'm following along a number of tutorials by [freeCodeCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/) and [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). So far, I've worked through a few of the videos on fCC -- holding off on the Odin Project until I get some minimum comfort with webdev.

Stay tuned!
